# `screener-server`

This will eventually be an http-serving thing that enables watching video from a DVD title in an app on an Apple TV or Android TV device.

Right now I'm just trying to get my head around Rust and the libdvdread library.

There may be a way of explicitly pulling in the C library dependency, but I don't know what it is, so `brew install libdvdread` or `apt-get install libdvdread-dev`...
